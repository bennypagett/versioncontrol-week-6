## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r readr, include=FALSE}
library(readr) 
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
df <- read_csv("data/2017_super-rugby_try-source-data.csv") ## load dataframe - Rugby analysis

```


```{r df summary, echo=FALSE}
summary(df) ##summary of dataframe
```

```{r initial exploration, include=TRUE}
head(df) ##exploratory analysis of data - head, tail and structure
tail(df)
str(df)
sum(is.na(df)) # count the missing values
head(which(is.na(df), arr.ind = TRUE)) # find where the missing values are (showing only first 6 rows)
```
### Missing values as 0's

## Need to convert 0's to NA's

```{r na conversion, include=TRUE}
df[df == 0] <- NA ##converts all 0's to NA values. i.e. implicit to explicit
sum(is.na(df)) # count the missing values and show there location
head(which(is.na(df), arr.ind = TRUE))
```

```{r exploratory analysis, include=TRUE}
head(df)
tail(df)
summarise(df)
```

###{r histogram, include= TRUE}
df <-df %>%
  ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = game_time), fill = "dodgerblue", colour = "black", stat = "count",
                 binwidth = 10)


## highest scoring team in super rugby
```{r attacking team points scored, include=TRUE}
df %>%
  ggplot(data = df) +
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = attacking_team, fill = attacking_team), colour = "black",
                   stat = "count", binwidth = .5)
```


``` {r brumbies try scoring analysis, include=TRUE}
brumbies_try_time <- df %>%
  filter(attacking_team == "Brumbies")
  mutate(brumbies_try_time = attacking_team == "Brumbies")
  
```  
  
  
```{r try_source analysis, include=TRUE}  
  brumbies_try_time %>%
    group_by(try_source) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = try_source, fill = try_source), colour = "black",
             stat = "count")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
